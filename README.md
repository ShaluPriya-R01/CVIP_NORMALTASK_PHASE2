## Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning
  This project aims to detect spam emails using various machine learning algorithms. It involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam).

## Overview
  The project utilizes a dataset containing email messages labeled as spam or ham. It cleans the text data, extracts relevant features, and trains machine learning models to classify emails. Three different algorithms are implemented and evaluated: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.This task was completed as a part of a project for CodersCave.

## Libraries Explanation
-Pandas: Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It is used to read, clean, and preprocess the email dataset.
-re: The re module provides support for regular expressions in Python. It is used for text cleaning and preprocessing tasks.
-NLTK: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides tools for text tokenization, stopwords removal, and stemming.
-scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is a machine learning library for Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It is used for feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
-Seaborn: Seaborn is a statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It is used to visualize the confusion matrix.
